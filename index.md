  # Hello, World!
  
  Welcome to my homepage. My name is Ruud and I am a software developer from Nĳmegen, the Netherlands.
---

I have been developing software professionally since 2012.
Most of my professional experience has been in web development for e-commerce organisations.
In my spare time I also like working on side projects, learning new programming languages, and trying out new web frameworks.

Some of the (programming) languages I work with are: Java, Kotlin, Scala, Go, Rust, JavaScript/Node.js, HTML, CSS, Ruby and Python.
