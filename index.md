  # Hello, World!

  Welcome to my homepage.
  My name is Ruud and I am a web developer from NÄ³megen, the Netherlands.
  On this website you can read about projects I am working on and technology I am following.

I have been developing software professionally since 2012.
Most of my professional experience has been in web development for e-commerce organisations.
In my spare time I also like working on side projects, learning new programming languages, and trying out new web frameworks.

Some of the (programming) languages I work with are: Java, Go, JavaScript (both client and server side), HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python and Perl.
I also have some experience with Rust and Scala.
